}
\arguments{
\item{ewas_data}{A data.frame with columns: cpg and a ranking column (e.g., p_value, score).}

\item{eQTM}{An eQTM object containing eQTM data.}

\item{k_values}{A numeric vector of top k CpGs to select (e.g., c(10, 50, 100)).}

\item{stat_grid}{A numeric vector of statistics thresholds.}

\item{distance_grid}{A numeric vector of distance thresholds.}

\item{overlap_threshold}{A numeric value for gene list overlap threshold.}

\item{databases}{A character vector of pathway databases (e.g., "Reactome").}

\item{rank_column}{A character string indicating which column in `ewas_data` to use for ranking (default: "p_value").}

\item{rank_decreasing}{Logical. If TRUE (default), sorts CpGs from high to low based on `rank_column`.
If FALSE, sorts from low to high. Use FALSE for p-values; TRUE for absolute statistics.}

\item{use_abs}{Logical. Whether to apply `abs()` to the ranking column (e.g., p-value, correlation, score) before sorting CpGs.}

\item{min_vote_support}{Minimum number of enrichment combinations in which a pathway must appear to be retained. Default = 3.}

\item{min_genes}{Minimum number of genes (`Count`) a pathway must include in any enrichment result to be considered. Default = 3.}

\item{verbose}{Logical, whether to print progress messages.}
}
\value{
A list containing enrichment results and CpG-gene mappings.
}
\description{
Performs pathway enrichment analysis using a voting-based approach on eQTM data.
